# **Fly On The Wall Lab**

### 1. Overview and Summary

After taking a look around the school environment, both literally in terms of the campus we walk around 5 days a week and technologically with our terms of communications throughout the school, there are a variety of observations that I have been able to make about our community including the design of many objects and settings around our campus that could be improved for the better. These could just be as simple as design of hallways and rooms as well as tables or chairs in these environments. Additionally, there are observations that can be basic blueprints for software which could combat future problems that could potentially arise from these. In my opinion, the largest overall problem present in our school would be FirstClass. It is a program that the entire school community uses almost everyday to stay in touch with each other, hear about upcoming events within or even outside of the local community and discuss assignments and homeworks with teachers. The main users of this platform are the students, teachers, and deans of Horace Mann School and they use it every day and rely on it to connect with each other. 


### Analysis

These observations sparked many ideas for me on ways to solve problems involving them or even just show why something might not work in our society, especially within the community and environment these observations were made in. For example, the biggest problem i found with first class is that sometimes emails glitch and send twice which ruin the overall experience and make interactions within the application more difficult than intended. 


### Description of Procedure

The process for finding most of these problems was simpler than I had originally expected. The best way I was able to complete this assignment was to take a deeper look into my everyday school routine and environments, interactions and users that I come in contact with everyday. Some of these observations have been previous problems or flaws that I've noticed in the past and never took the time to analyze before this project.
