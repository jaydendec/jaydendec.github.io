#Fly On The Wall Lab

###1. Overview and Summary

After taking a look around the school environment, both literally in terms of the campus we walk around 5 days a week and technologically with our terms of communications throughout the school, there are a variety of observations that I have been able to make about our community. The observations are the basic blueprints for software that could combat future problems that could arise from these. In my opinion, the largest overall problem present in our school would be FirstClass. It is a program that the entire school community uses almost everyday to stay in touch with each other, hear about upcoming events within or even outside of the local community and discuss assignments and homeworks with teachers.
