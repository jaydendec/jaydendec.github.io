# Task Review Overview Part 2

The tasks that we came up with were all interconnected within the areas and processes of crowds at horace mann, more specifically the library, snack, and dismissal areas. Our UX research was the main contributor to our tasks and we plan to continue to use this data as well as future observations to help prototype our design.

## Giving out snacks to students during break
Faculty member B walks through the school to Fisher Patio carrying a couple large Fresh-Direct bags full of snacks. Faculty member B brings the snack to Fisher which was a previously communicated location. This is a longer walk but provides a warm place for winter snack and ultimately was a wiser choice for B and the community. 


## Going to the snack station from the library

Student 1 starts off in the library after finishing some difficult work for their class directly after break. In the library space by the computers, there are small groups of students having conversations while standing in the middle of the paths, blocking student 1 from passing easily. After navigating through these initial crowds, student 1 gets to the stairwell where more students are unaware of their mistakes and yell over to their friend at the other side of the room. This in itself is a problem because the staircase is a place to connect students from one elevation to another in a flow that allows multiple people to use it at one time, as well as in both directions. Standing stagnant blocking one slide of the staircase means students must squeeze by and block the opposing direction of traffic from getting up or down the stairs. After completing the descent down the staircase, student 1 must walk through the crowd that just got their snack and continue to eat and talk with friends with masks off. At a time where preventing the spread of covid-19 is at utmost priority, this isn’t ideal. Additionally, there is a large crowd of students gathered around the station slowly making their way toward the center of the crowd.

## Getting snack in a simple and efficient manner. (ideal way)

The line to snack is always crowded, since the entire upper division has the ability to get one. The hard working Horace Mann members always could always use a quick snack break. Student 2 has just arrived near the snack station easily, the paths being clear of all traffic and there is a single file line on the side of the path. Everyone in front of the student gets their snack and moves out of the way, refraining from making too much conversation in the middle of the path and doing so helps lower the time students spend with their masks off, preventing the spread of Covid-19. Then, on the way back inside of the building, students continue to walk in their respective lanes and do not stop in the middle of the hallway to converse with their friends. This allows everyone to get where they want to go efficiently. 

## Finding your bus
Student X finished science class and left Lutnick through the 1st floor exit facing Tibbett Avenue. He left at about 3:17 and headed towards the large whiteboard, with the bus numbers and locations, on the sidewalk next to the large gates of Alumni Field. Student X had to leave through the small staircase all the way at the edge of the field because the large gates were closed. There were an unbelievable amount of middle schoolers in line. This slowed us down greatly and once we reached the sidewalk, there were many clusters and groups formed along the sidewalk. As Student X went down the sidewalk, people knocked into him and blocked his way. However, he was able to get to the whiteboard and find out his bus number. Once he found out what his bus number was, he headed down Tibbett Avenue in search of his bus. Except for the occasional student blocking his way, he made it safe and sound.

## Helping students get to their bus safely
Staff A left through Olshen Lobby with their neon green vest in preparation for the bus dismissal. They had the walkie talkies clipped on their belt and communicated with the security on Tibbett Avenue. Staff A and the other staff began to write down bus numbers on the whiteboard before school ended. Staff A then waited for about ten minutes for school to end. As the students continued to make their way to the whiteboard, Staff A was clearly overwhelmed by the amount of students. Staff A was holding a laminated sheet with the bus stops and routes. There were many students bombarding Staff A with questions. However, after ten minutes, all the students had found their way to the bus stop and Staff A went back into Olshan Lobby.


# Our Initial Designs

## Design #1: Snack Stations around campus

![designcheckin1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95443524/154167990-2c3a621d-4352-4ad9-aa1c-c083b3d288c7.jpg)


Every day during break, students come from all different buildings around campus and have to walk all the way around the field just to get to the snack station. This is not ideal for some people who have to fit in multiple activities between this 15 minute period such as printing documents, stoppiing by a teachers office, or getting across the field again early in preparation for an exam. The wintertime makes this an even harder task to do because the field is closed off and everyone is forced to walk all in one area. Installing multiple snack stations at many popular locations on campus addresses this problem by cutting down the time students have to walk outside in the cold to run and get a snack, eat it away from people (usually outside), and complete whatever tasks they need to do before their D period class. These stations could either be run by their own staff member who would hand out the snacks to students, or they could be electronic and hand out snacks like a vending machine. With the electronic choice the machines would be programmed to open at 10:00 and close at 10:15 and (crazy idea but it could recoognize if someone is getting multiple snacks in one break to insure that everyone has a chance to get the snack of their choice without having to worry about someone getting more than they should.)
#### The tasks that this addresses are:
1. getting snack during break
2. going from the library (or anywhere else on campus) to a snack station
3. eating snack and printing a document or meeting with a teacher in the 15 minute break period
4. giving out snack to everyone on campus



## Design #2: Campus Renovation and Overhaul ~ Zen Horace Mann
![Scannable Document on Feb 14, 2022 at 3_00_21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90795393/154168237-d2e38e92-b014-4645-9949-005f1a30754e.png)

This idea is fairly radical. It is our out-of-the-box idea. The image above is relatively self explanitory. Using our imaginations we proposed the creation of HM 2.0. The design includes overall more tranquil and open concept campus. The campus would also remove the heavily busy hallways in large building and place yurts around campus. Students could walk peacefully to a geometry yurt for class or walk to the English Yurt Pavilion.

#### The tasks that this addresses are:
1. Limiting lines and closed spaces
2. Opening up campus
3. Reduces opportunities for lines and bottlenecks



## Design #3: Introducing an HM App that Informs Students

![IMG_2192](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90796138/154342708-4354fb93-4b66-403b-b939-cf8e6c5cd379.jpg)

The focus of the CCC is dealing with crowds that form throughout the campus. Two moments where large crowds form are when getting snack during break at 10:00 a.m, and towards the end of the day when everyone is heading towards the buses. This app focuses on informing students with information about the location of their buses and what snack there is that day. The app would have a login feature that would personalize the information to each students’ needs. For example, instead of having to force through crowds and ask the staff what number your bus is, the app tells you what number your bus is and where along Tibbett Avenue it is. The information will update daily in case of any sudden changes. The second option inside of the app will inform students on the snack of the day. Because crowds always form because people don’t know what the snack is, this app will hopefully partially eliminate crowds from forming. 


#### The tasks that this adresses are:
1. Facilitating crowds by informing everyone their bus numbers and their location
2. Facilitating crowds in snack area by informing people what snack their is for that day
3. Opens up the campus
