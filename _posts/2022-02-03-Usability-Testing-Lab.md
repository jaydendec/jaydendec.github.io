### Usability Testing Lab

The CCC is focusing on dispersing crowds throughout our local community (Horace Mann campus) in order to make the studentâ€™s daily lives easier. Our design sketch revolves around informing students on their bus number/location and the snack locations around campus. The design takes the form of an app. By making the design an app, it will ideally make it more accessible for students around the campus. We came to this conclusion by performing many interviews, fly-on-the-wall-labs, and UX research. Our first contextual inquiry was taken via Fly-On-The-Fall observation, we were able to see many crowded situations throughout Olshan lobby and mainy doors and staircases. In our second contextual inquiry we collected information through a mixed method, from this we learned that faculty members had taken notes on such issues and hoped to resolve these issues. From this research we were guided to three main ideas: zenHM, organizing snacks, and an app for buses. 
The Guided Design Check-in Critiques that we had in class refined our final design. After we presented to all the groups and received the feedback from the audience, we looked at the questions and critiques that they had for us. After reading through them we worked on our design following some of the advice that other groups gave us. Out of the three designs we thought of at first, our classmates preferred the app design. We also acknowledged that the audience enjoyed the idea of having multiple stations for snack stations. We implemented different aspects from all the critiques and contextual inquiries into our current design.

Tasks:
Finding the location and number of your bus efficiently
Accessing snack quickly

These two tasks are the most important to improving the community because they rest at the front of all of the underlying problems that the CCC hopes to deal with. Most of the problems branch from these two main inconveniences. Especially since snack and dismissal are regular occurrences throughout the week, it would be best to find ways to better the already stressful lives of the horace mann students as well as help lighten the amount of effort the staff needs to do to keep everyone in an ideal order. Our design will take into account all of the prior research we have gathered and will make the lives of everyone easier. Regarding the buses, there will be more of an information finding section about the location and number of a student bus while the snack side covers how much of a crowd there is at a station + the snack schedule.
