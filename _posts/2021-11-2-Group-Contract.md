*Origins:*
We are the CCC. The CROWD CONTROL COMMITTEE. Our name is simple, catchy, and memorable. We hope to work to learn about the crowd flow problems on our campus and from our data and research continue working with our community in bettering ourselves. We have all faced issues when it comes to overcrowding and our committee intends to control the crowds. We look forward to sharing our work as the year progresses.

*Our Logo:*
We have created a logo that encompasses the CCC's mission. It is made of yellow and orange circles which symbolize the circular nature of our problem and also our solution. We have our name the 'Crowd Control Committee' wrapped around another inner circle. Under our name we have the names of our committee members: Jayden, Santi, and Lynn. Finally, in the center is a hand with a heart. This represents are calming approach we strive to have with our whole hearts.
