*Who?:* A Faculty Member
We believe it is important to interview a faculty member because they hold a different side of the story than we currently understand it as. We have a many faculty members on campus who serve in a meriad of ways. Depending on the level of familiarity we may discuss an interview informally and then plan it later, or we may send an email explaining our project and our goals. We would have two committee members present one interviewing and one recording. We would interview in a neutral part of campus during a pre-planned time that works for everyone.
