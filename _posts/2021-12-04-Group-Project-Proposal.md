## Contextual Inquiries

The users that would find benefits with a design for these problems with crowd control are most importantly community members who access these areas frequently throughout the week, during and after the school day. Regarding these early contextual inquiries, we are planning to speak with 2 of the Horace Mann staff members whoâ€™s everyday jobs involve them managing these areas. One being Ms.Bartels, a head member of the library staff who also works with handing out snacks to the crowds of kids who visit her during break. An interview will be conducted with her where we ask her about what she notices at break and if she has any problems with how it is managed or ideas for resolving said problems. The CCC will also be taking a wide approach to break as well, taking notes on what they notice without influencing anyone in the crowd to change their interactions. A similar process will happen when we interview one of the staff that manages dismissal by telling students which busses have arrived and which busses go to their respective routes. Since so many students ask everyday which bus will be taking them home that day, it can get extremely crowded around the area with the bus board. These staff members are in the crowd first hand every day. Observing the community interactions is another key part in gathering information about smaller potential problems than our main one of crowd control management. Finally, a student in the Horace Mann community who takes the bus and uses the library space for snacks is the perfect person to speak to about their own individual experiences with these spaces. Talking to a student especially gives us a look into how people just like us interact with the environment and others in these spaces. The inquiries will definitely be able to take place within the span of one week because these events occur every day of the school week and it will be easy to find someone in the crowd to speak to for just a few minutes, of course, while taking into consideration the social distancing rules to keep our community safe.
