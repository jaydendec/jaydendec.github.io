# Task Review Overview


The tasks that we came up with were all interconnected within the areas and processes of crowds at horace mann, more specifically the library, snack, and dismissal areas. Our UX research was the main contributor to our tasks and we plan to continue to use this data as well as future observations to help prototype our design.


## Library → Snack Station (Student Perspective)

Student 1 starts off in the library after finishing some difficult work for their class directly after break. In the library space by the computers, there are small groups of students having conversations while standing in the middle of the paths, blocking student 1 from passing easily. After navigating through these initial crowds, student 1 gets to the stairwell where more students are unaware of their mistakes and yell over to their friend at the other side of the room. This in itself is a problem because the staircase is a place to connect students from one elevation to another in a flow that allows multiple people to use it at one time, as well as in both directions. Standing stagnant blocking one slide of the staircase means students must squeeze by and block the opposing direction of traffic from getting up or down the stairs. After completing the descent down the staircase, student 1 must walk through the crowd that just got their snack and continue to eat and talk with friends with masks off. At a time where preventing the spread of covid-19 is at utmost priority, this isn’t ideal. Additionally, there is a large crowd of students gathered around the station slowly making their way toward the center of the crowd.

## Ideal way to receive and eat snack during break

The line to snack is always crowded, since the entire upper division has the ability to get one. The hard working Horace Mann members always could always use a quick snack break. Student 2 has just arrived near the snack station easily, the paths being clear of all traffic and there is a single file line on the side of the path. Everyone in front of the student gets their snack and moves out of the way, refraining from making too much conversation in the middle of the path and doing so helps lower the time students spend with their masks off, preventing the spread of Covid-19. Then, on the way back inside of the building, students continue to walk in their respective lanes and do not stop in the middle of the hallway to converse with their friends. This allows everyone to get where they want to go efficiently.
